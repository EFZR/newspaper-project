# NEWSPAPER - PROJECT

## Description 🚀

The project is a college 🎓 project made by the Group #4, from the 4th year of the Computer Science course at the University of UNICAH 🏛, in Honduras.
This has the purpose of creating a newspaper Mobile app, where the user can read the news, through an API taken from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/).
We enjoy and learn ⚡ a lot from this project, and we hope you enjoy it too!
A greeting from Honduras and the group #4 💗!
