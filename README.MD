# NEWSPAPER - PROJECT

## Description

The project is a college project made by the Group #4, from the 4th year of the Computer Science course at the University of UNICAH, in Honduras.
This has the purpose of creating a newspaper website, where the user can read the news, through an API taken from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/).
We enjoy and learn a lot from this project, and we hope you enjoy it too!
A greeting from the group #4 and Honduras ðŸ’—!
